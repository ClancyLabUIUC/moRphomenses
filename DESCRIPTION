Description: Tools that make it easy to apply geometric morphometric principles 
    to the study of hormone profiles. Easily transform daily measures into multivariate
    landmark-based data. Includes custom functions to apply multivariate methods
    for data exploration as well as hypothesis testing. Also includes shiny webapp
    to streamline data exploration. Developed to study menstrual cycle hormones but
    should be applicable to any biomarker over any time period.
